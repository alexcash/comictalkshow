Every week I read a few comic comic books with my cousin, and then record a podcast about it. This is the source for the podcast's homepage. Check it out at [comictalkshow.com](http://www.comictalkshow.com/).

I had heard about the stupid easy deploy story of jekyll and github and decided to give it a go. I previously built [alexca.sh](http://alexca.sh) with [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) so I'd had some experience with static site generation. I enjoyed it. The feature set is certainly much smaller, but it's also faster to get up and running.

I used compass, but only check in the compiled stylesheet to keep what's actualy avaialbe clean. Other tools include twitter bootstrap, jquery, and font awesome. The back side of this cabinet is not painted. If you want to see example of good engineering, check out one of my other repos.
